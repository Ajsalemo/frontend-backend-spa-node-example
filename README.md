# frontend-backend-spa-node-example

This is a very basic example of using a front end (in this case, a SPA - React) having it's production build for the UI be served by an Express.js server.

This is to show an example of how to deploy a "coupled" application to a single App Service, instead of seperating the front and back ends.

To run the example:
- Run `npm run build`
- Run `npm run start`
